a 3 hour session from 2 pm to 5 pm every week in which you perform one of the experiments  
The day of your lab session depends on your lab batch  
P13 = Monday  
P14 = Tuesday  
P15 = Thursday  
P16 = Friday  

### List of Experiments
1) Laser Diffraction
2) Grating Spectrometer
3) Fresnel BiPrism
4) e/m
5) Helmholtz Coil
6) LCR Circuit
7) Thermal Conductivity by Leeâ€™s Disc method
8) Centrifugal Force 

## Evaluation
Average of the 8 experiment(out of 60, rounded to nearest integer) + Marks obtained in final lab exam(out of 40, rounded to nearest integer) = Marks Obtained  

Grade guidelines(MAY BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE)
91 - 100 = AA  
86 - 90 = AB  
81 - 85 = BB  
76 - 80 = BC  
71 - 75 = CC  
66 - 70 = CD  
50 - 65 = DD  
Below 50 = FR
